# GUC-Tutor

The aim of this application is to provide an interface for GUC engineering students to connect and help each other. Students who need help in any subject may contact their peers for help. Students who are confident enough in any course can offer to help others.

To run this application you need to:

1. Create a .env file, provided below is a sample:
mongoURI=The connection string to your database is written here
secretOrKey=A password of your choice goes here
mockarooKey=The API key provided to you by mockaroo is placed here

2. Run the command "npm i" from the command line to install backend dependencies from the root directory

3. Run the command "npm i" from the command line to install frontend dependencies from the client directory

4. Next you need to start your server using the command "node server" from the command line in the root directory

5. Finally run the command "npm start" from the command line in the client directory to get your application up and running

Enjoy learning!
